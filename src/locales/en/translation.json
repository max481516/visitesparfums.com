    "Review1": "My daughter and I enjoyed our perfume walk with Natacha, who lives what she teaches, working in the perfume industry in Paris. We liked hearing about her own personal experiences on top of learning much about the history of perfume in France. We visited several niche perfume shops near Place des Vosges, which fit in nicely with our quest to find a souvenir scent to bring home. We felt some expectation (but no pressure) to make a purchase, but we were not yet ready to choose. This was a unique experience and a lovely way to spend an afternoon in Paris.",

Tout d'abord, vous pouvez toujours y trouver BEAUCOUP d'attractions et d'activités touristiques, mais ce n'est pas un vrai Paris avec son histoire (qui est bien sûr liée à la parfumerie) et son ambiance. Cette visite nous a ouvert les portes de boutiques uniques de marques Niche à Paris, nous avons appris des nouveautés sur l'histoire des parfums et goûté de nombreux parfums. En outre, nous avons trouvé des parfums qui correspondent à notre humeur et à notre caractère. Je recommande donc vivement cette visite si vous voulez passer votre temps de manière significative et avec un grand plaisir.",

  "aboutMeDescription": "I live, I sleep and I breathe perfume. I have always been in love with fragrances and have had the chance to combine my passion with my work, which gives me unique expertise in this field. The knowledge that I acquired allowed me to see all the stages of the life of a perfume: from its creation to its sale. Today I decided to share my passion with others by creating @visitesparfumsparis which aims to make you discover the sensory and unique world of fragrances during visits to the most beautiful fragrances boutiques of Paris."
